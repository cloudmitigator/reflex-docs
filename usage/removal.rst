Removing/Updating Reflex Infrastructure
===========================================

Applying Updates
--------------------------------
As our cloud environments change, there will inevitably be updates to our Reflex infrastructure and the addition of new security rules. By leveraging terraform, we can update our built terraform modules with a simple call to ``terraform apply``. 

Removing Infrastructure
---------------------------
