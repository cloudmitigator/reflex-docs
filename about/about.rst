What is Reflex?
==================================

Reflex is a collection of open source tools and modules that allow you to enforce security best practices in your cloud environment. Reflex works by deploying resources which monitor your environment, and automatically fixes resources that are configured in an insecure manner. Best of all, Reflex is event driven, so problems are fixed as they happen. No manual intervention required.
