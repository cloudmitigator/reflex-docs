Why Should I Use Reflex?
==================================
Reflex helps you quickly and easily secure the resources in your AWS account. It provides the most important security controls that we believe should be implemented in every account out of the box, and a mechanism to add your own controls if you need additional protections.

And since Reflex is open source and free to use, it's easy and low risk to try out Reflex and see if it meets your cloud infrastructure security needs.
